# Compass

This repository contains the source code for [Compass](https://compassmeet.com) — a transparent platform for forming
deep, authentic 1-on-1 connections with clarity and efficiency.

## Features

- Extremely detailed profiles for deep connections
- Radically transparent: user base fully searchable
- Free, ad-free, not for profit (supported by donations)
- Created, hosted, maintained, and moderated by volunteers
- Open-source
- Democratically governed

You can find a lot of interesting info in the [About page](https://www.compassmeet.com/about) and
the [FAQ](https://www.compassmeet.com/faq) as well.
A detailed description of the early vision is also available in
this [blog post](https://martinbraquet.com/meeting-rational) (you can disregard the parts about rationality, as Compass
shifted to a more general audience).

**We can’t do this alone.** Whatever your skills—coding, design, writing, moderation, marketing, or even small
donations—you can make a real difference. [Contribute](https://www.compassmeet.com/support) in any way you can and help
our community thrive!

## To Do

No contribution is too small—whether it’s changing a color, resizing a button, tweaking a font, or improving wording.
Bigger contributions like adding new profile fields, building modules, or improving onboarding are equally welcome. The
goal is to make the platform better step by step, and every improvement counts. If you see something that could be
clearer, smoother, or more engaging, **please jump in**!

The complete, official list of tasks is
available [here on ClickUp](https://sharing.clickup.com/90181043445/l/h/6-901810339879-1/bbfd32f4f4bf64b). If you are
working on one task, just assign it to yourself and move its status to "in progress". If there is also a GitHub issue
for that task, assign it to yourself as well.

To have edit access to the ClickUp workspace, you need an admin to manually give you permission (one time thing). To do
so, use your preferred option:

- Ask or DM an admin on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8Vd7jzqjun)
- Email hello@compassmeet.com
- Raise an issue on GitHub

If you want to add tasks without creating an account, you can simply email

```

## Implementation

The web app is coded in Typescript using React as front-end. It includes:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) for the PostgreSQL database
- [Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com) for hosting the backend API
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication and media storage
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for hosting the front-end

## Development

Below are the steps to contribute. If you have any trouble or questions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or
contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/8Vd7jzqjun)! We're responsive and happy to help.

### Installation

Fork the [repo](https://github.com/CompassConnections/Compass) on GitHub (button in top right). Then, clone your repo
and navigating into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Compass.git
cd Compass
```

Install `yarn` (if not already installed):

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Then, install the dependencies for this project:

```bash
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Tests

Make sure the Jest tests pass:

```bash
yarn test
```

If they don't and you can't find out why, simply raise an issue! Sometimes it's something on our end that we overlooked.

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Once the server is running, visit http://localhost:3000 to start using the app. You can sign up and visit the profiles;
you should see a few synthetic profiles.

Note: it's normal if page loading locally is much slower than the deployed version. It can take up to 10 seconds, it
would be great to improve that though!

#### Full isolation

Running `yarn dev:isolated` spins up a local Supabase and Firebase emulator instead of pointing at the shared remote
database. This is strongly recommended for day-to-day development:

- **Freedom** — Reset, wipe, and reseed your local database as many times as you want without affecting other
  contributors.
- **No conflicts** — Multiple contributors can work simultaneously without stepping on each other's data or schema.
- **Works offline** — No internet required once services are started locally.
- **Faster** — No network latency on every database query.

However, running in full isolation requires installing several heavy dependencies:

- **Docker** (~500MB) — runs the Supabase Postgres container
- **Supabase CLI** — manages the local Supabase stack (10+ Docker containers, ~1-2GB RAM when running)
- **Java 21+** (~300MB) — required by Firebase emulators
- **Firebase CLI** — manages the local Firebase emulators

First startup is slow (30-60s) and the stack uses significant memory. If your machine has less than 8GB RAM, you may
notice slowdowns.

If this feels like too much, you can skip isolation entirely — `yarn dev` works out of the box against the shared remote
and is perfectly fine for most contributions, especially UI changes, wording fixes, or anything that doesn't touch the
database or authentication.

###### Setup instructions

As always, don't hesitate to raise an issue if you run into any problems!

Docker

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian (native - recommended over snap)
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sudo sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for group changes to take effect

# macOS
brew install --cask docker
# Or download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

# Verify
docker --version
```

Supabase CLI

```bash
# Verify it got installed from `yarn install`
npx supabase --version
```

Java 21+

```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk

# macOS
brew install openjdk@21

# Verify (must be 21+)
java -version
```

Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Verify
firebase --version
```

Run in isolation

```bash
yarn dev:isolated
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` as usual. Your local database comes preloaded with synthetic test profiles so the app
looks and feels like the real thing.

### Contributing

Now you can start contributing by making changes and submitting pull requests!

We recommend using a good code editor (VSCode, WebStorm, Cursor, etc.) with Typescript support and a good AI assistant (
GitHub Copilot, etc.) to make your life easier. To debug, you can use the browser developer tools (F12), specifically:

- Components tab to see the React component tree and props (you need to install
  the [React Developer Tools](https://react.dev/learn/react-developer-tools) extension)
- Console tab for errors and logs
- Network tab to see the requests and responses
- Storage tab to see cookies and local storage

You can also add `console.log()` statements in the code.

If you are new to Typescript or the open-source space, you could start with small changes, such as tweaking some web
components or improving wording in some pages. You can find those files in `web/public/md/`.

##### Resources

There is a lot of documentation in the [docs](docs) folder and across the repo, namely:

- [Next.js.md](docs/Next.js.md) for core fundamentals about our web / page-rendering framework.
- [knowledge.md](docs/knowledge.md) for general information about the project structure.
- [development.md](docs/development.md) for additional instructions, such as adding new profile fields or languages.
- [TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md) for how to write tests.
- [PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md](docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md) for frontend, backend, and database performance best
  practices.
- [DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOLING.md](docs/DATABASE_CONNECTION_POOLING.md) for database connection management and
  troubleshooting.
- [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for resolving common development issues.
- [web](web) for the web.
- [backend/api](backend/api) for the backend API.
- [android](android) for the Android app.

There are a lot of useful scripts you can use in the [scripts](scripts) folder.

### Submission

Add the original repo as upstream for syncing:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/CompassConnections/Compass.git
```

Create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

Make changes, then stage and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
```

Push branch to your fork:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

Finally, open a Pull Request on GitHub from your `fork/<branch-name>` → `CompassConnections/Compass` main branch.

### Environment Variables

Almost all the features will work out of the box, so you can skip this step and come back later if you need to test the
following services: email, geolocation.

We can't make the following information public, for security and privacy reasons:

- Database, otherwise anyone could access all the user data (including private messages)
- Firebase, otherwise anyone could remove users or modify the media files
- Email, analytics, and location services, otherwise anyone could use the service plans Compass paid for and run up the
  bill.

That's why we separate all those services between production and development environments, so that you can code freely
without impacting the functioning of the deployed platform.
Contributors should use the default keys for local development. Production uses a separate environment with stricter
rules and private keys that are not shared.

If you do need one of the few remaining services, you need to set them up and store your own secrets as environment
variables. To do so, simply open `.env` and fill in the variables according to the instructions in the file.

## Acknowledgements

This project is built on top of [manifold.love](https://github.com/sipec/polylove), an open-source dating platform

significantly aided in the development of some core features such as direct messaging, prompts, and email notifications.
We invite the community to explore and contribute to other open-source projects like manifold.love as well, especially
if you're interested in functionalities that deviate from Compass' ideals of deep, intentional connections.
